GoRestaurant is a web application for registering different types of dishes in a virtual menu. It uses a fake API to get the menu data.

This was a good exercise for migrating a React application from Javascript and Class Components to Typescript and Function Components.

## User Stories
- The user can add a new dish
- The user can update the information of an existing dish
- The user can delete an existing dish
- The user can indicate whether the dish is available or not
- All dishes should be rendered into the screen in a centralized grid

## Installation
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/mpinheiro-it/GoRestaurant.git
- Install dependencies with yarn or npm install
- Run the application locally with yarn start or npm start
- Run the fake API with yarn server or npm run server
- Open the application in your browser at localhost:3000/
